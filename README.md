# Youthful Misperceptions

One morning while I was reflecting on something, an inspiration struck me. I thought of writing a book called "Youthful Misperceptions" that describes some of the misperceptions youths live with and the impact these misconceptions would have on their lives in the long run.

I stated it on my WhatSapp status and about two people encouraged me to write the book. I knew that though I love writing, I find writing time consuming most of the time. I knew that if I must get myself to write the book, I needed something to encourage myself. Then an idea came:

> Thinking of something...as regarding the book ðŸ˜Œ.
>
> I will build a small web app for the book this week...and then release each chapter as a webpage every week, to force myself to pursue it.
>
> Anybody can read the chapters...and suggest ways to improve them via comments.
>
> Once I have completed the chapters, I will compile it into a PDF which would be available for download for a small fee.
> **Cool?**

I said to two friends of mine. They said it was a good idea.

**And this repository was born!**
